Hey there! I'm Jim Frank ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate web designer with over 3 years of experience in coding. What started as a hobby has now become my career. I've worked on a variety of projects, both personal and for clients, crafting functional websites that are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly.

I thrive on new challenges and find joy in programming, whether it's competitive coding or building something just for fun. If you have a project in mind or simply want to connect, feel free to leave me a message. Let's create something amazing togetherâ€”I'm sure it will be worthwhile!

Let us start a collaboration. I have a feeling this will be big
